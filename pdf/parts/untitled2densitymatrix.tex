The approach that we 'll follow in this thesis is not the usual undergraduate axiomatic prescription. Even though that approach has certain conceptual advantages in this case we need to take a different path for reasons that will become clear later. In this philosophy we will start by representing the state of a system with the density matrix/operator $\rho$.
\begin{equation}\rho=\sum_{s} p_{s}\left|\psi_{s}\right\rangle\left\langle\psi_{s}\right|\end{equation}
$\rho$ in general is what you would call a mixed state. Meaning a statistical ensemble of pure quantum states.
